# Project 0x04: TypeScript

This ongoing TypeScript project, led by Johann Kerbrat, an Engineering Manager at Uber Works, started on January 10, 2024, at 6:00 AM, and must conclude by January 13, 2024, at 6:00 AM. The project involves exploring TypeScript fundamentals, such as basic types, interfaces, classes, functions, and advanced TypeScript concepts. Manual QA review is required, and resources for learning TypeScript are provided.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, participants are expected to:

- Explain basic types in TypeScript
- Understand and work with interfaces, classes, and functions
- Learn how to interact with the DOM using TypeScript
- Explore generic types and namespaces
- Comprehend nominal typing in TypeScript

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
- Files should end with a new line
- TypeScript scripts will be transpiled on Ubuntu 18.04
- TS scripts checked with Jest (version 24.9.*)
- Mandatory README.md file at the project root

## Tasks Overview

1. **Creating an interface for a student:** Implement a TypeScript interface for students and use it to create and display a table.

2. **Let's build a Teacher interface:** Develop a TypeScript interface for teachers, allowing additional attributes dynamically.

3. **Extending the Teacher class:** Extend the Teacher class with a Directors interface requiring an attribute named numberOfReports.

4. **Printing teachers:** Write a function to print teacher names and locations based on provided parameters.

5. **Advanced types Part 1:** Create interfaces and classes for Directors and Teachers with specific methods, and implement a function to create employee instances.

6. **Creating functions specific to employees:** Write functions to identify director instances and execute work based on employee type.

7. **String literal types:** Define a string literal type named Subjects and create a function to teach specific subjects.

8. **Ambient Namespaces:** Develop an ambient namespace and implement CRUD operations using provided external library functions.

9. **Namespace & Declaration merging:** Implement interfaces and classes within namespaces to organize subject-related functionality, including declaration merging.

10. **Update task_4/js/main.ts:** Use the created interfaces and classes to set up constants and objects representing Cpp, Java, and React subjects, and demonstrate their functionalities.

11. **Brand convention & Nominal typing:** Create interfaces for MajorCredits and MinorCredits with a brand property, and implement functions to sum major and minor credits.
