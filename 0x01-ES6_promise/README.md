**0x01. ES6 Promises**

This project guides you through the world of ES6 Promises in JavaScript, providing practical exercises to reinforce your understanding. Below are the tasks you'll encounter:

1. **Promise Basics**
   - Create a Promise using a given prototype function.
   - Task Location: `0-promise.js`

2. **Resolving and Rejecting Promises**
   - Develop a function that returns a Promise based on a boolean parameter, showcasing resolution and rejection.
   - Task Location: `1-promise.js`

3. **Handling Promise Resolutions and Rejections**
   - Enhance a function with handlers for Promise resolutions and rejections, logging appropriate messages.
   - Task Location: `2-then.js`

4. **Handling Multiple Promises**
   - Import promises from `utils.js` and collectively resolve them, logging the results to the console.
   - Task Location: `3-all.js`

5. **Creating Simple Promises**
   - Develop a function returning a resolved promise with specific attributes.
   - Task Location: `4-user-promise.js`

6. **Rejecting Promises with Errors**
   - Implement a function returning a Promise rejecting with an error message.
   - Task Location: `5-photo-reject.js`

7. **Handling Multiple Promises and Load Balancing**
   - Import functions from previous tasks, combining them to handle promises collectively. Additionally, create a load balancer function.
   - Task Location: `6-final-user.js`, `7-load_balancer.js`

8. **Error Handling with Try-Catch**
   - Write a function using try-catch blocks for effective error handling in asynchronous operations.
   - Task Location: `8-try.js`

9. **Advanced Error Handling**
   - Develop a function creating an array and populating it with values or error messages from a provided math function. The process is accompanied by a specific message.
   - Task Location: `9-try.js`

10. **Async/Await**
    - Implement an async function utilizing the `await` keyword to handle asynchronous calls and return a structured object.
    - Task Location: `100-await.js`
