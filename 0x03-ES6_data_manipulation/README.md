# Project 0x03: ES6 Data Manipulation

This JavaScript project focuses on ES6 data manipulation, covering topics like arrays, typed arrays, and set and map data structures. It includes tasks that require implementing functions to manipulate data using ES6 features. The tasks involve creating functions for mapping, filtering, reducing, and working with typed arrays, sets, and maps. The project requires adherence to coding standards, passing tests with Jest, and linting with ESLint.
